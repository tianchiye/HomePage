abstract: This paper studies the minimum thermo-tuning resolution for calibrating and steering the 1-D optical phased array (OPA) through simulation and experiment. Through simulation, we determined the factors, including antenna pitch d, wavelength, and calibration procedure, that affect the phase tuning resolution requirement of 1-D OPAs. Simulation results show that the resolution can be reduced to 2 bits without degrading the beam quality. Furthermore, an OPA with 128 antennas is implemented. Experimental results validate that 2 bits resolution is sufficient to calibrate the 1-D OPA with the most power concentrated at the target direction.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this study, we determine the factors that influence the thermo-tuning resolution requirement of 1-D OPAs. The antenna pitch d, wavelength, and antenna number N have just a minor impact, while the calibration procedures have a significant impact on the minimum resolution. Furthermore, we also figure out the minimum phase tuning resolution required for calibrating and controlling 1-D OPAs.Experimental results agree well with our simulation results that 2 bits resolution is sufficient to tune OPAs with specified algorithms. We are optimistic that this finding will reduce the complexity and cost to drive OPAs, promoting the co-design of optical devices and control circuits of OPAs and encouraging the widespread use of OPAs.
